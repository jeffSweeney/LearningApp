# LearningApp
An app with learning modules and assessment sections

## Used Code Disclosure

The code that appears in style.html and in the content.lessons.explanation field of data.json is *NOT* 
mine. This was simply adopted from the Swift docs for simple styling boilerplates.

## Mixed Data Sources
This app is powered by 2 different data sources:
* Swift Modules & Tests
  * Local JSON data  
* SwiftUI Modules & Tests
  * Remote JSON data hosted on GitHub Pages
